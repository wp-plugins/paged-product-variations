# Paged Product Variations for WooCommerce
Paged Product Variations for WooCommerce is a project committed to making large storefronts using WooCommerce manageable by having the variations in the back-end paginated.

## Example
The below is an example of what the plugin looks like in action. The default setting (which can be changed via a filter) is 10 variations per page.

## Installation
Grab a zip of the repository and drop it in your 'plugins' folder inside WordPress. I'll also be looking to place this on the official WP plugins repo.

## TODO
1. Input field to go to a specific page.
2. Better layout for systems with a _large_ number of variations (thousands)
3. Ability to search through variations by SKU (including SKU pattern)
4. Possibly a setting to change the number per page - currently this can be done via a filter
5. Warning to notify when variations have been added / edited (to prevent data from being lost)
